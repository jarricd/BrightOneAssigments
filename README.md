# BrightOneAssigments
Code repository with solutions to internship recruitment assigments.

Excuse me the use of two Github accounts, Github keeps confusing them, no matter how I configure my git shell. (Alienwaren and jarricd are my accounts)

I've been using Visual Studio 2017 as IDE, so those assigments are inside single Visual Studio Solution, divided to two projects. 

Inside BrightOneAssigment_1 directory you can find solution to Assigment 1, where 
`BrightOneAssigment_1.cpp` contains the code, the same schema follows for Assigment 2.

Inside `Release` directory, there are *exe files with solutions to assigments. 

file.txt - input file for Assigment 1.
evens.txt - output file with assigment solution data consisting of numbers with even count of ones, separated with spaces for sake of readability.
odds.txt - output file with assigment soluton data consisting of numbers with odd count of ones, separated with spaces for sake of readability.
